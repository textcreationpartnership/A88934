            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>AMong all the many <hi>Subjects</hi> which a Preacher of the Gospel has to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I know not whether any would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a greater <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> than that of the <hi>Types</hi> which exhibited Evangelical Mysteries unto <hi>Israel</hi> of old; in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon which, the Advantage that we <hi>Now</hi> have to compare the <hi>Shadow</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford unto us a rich variety of <hi>Observations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, which none but one that shall <hi>come and see,</hi> can imagine the value of. The Learned <hi>Rothwel,</hi> being advised by a Clergy-man more <hi>Great</hi> than <hi>Wise,</hi> to forbear medling with the <hi>Types,</hi> as <hi>Themes</hi> not convenient for him to study upon, made that very <hi>prohibition,</hi> but as an <hi>Invitation</hi> to expect, something of a more than common Import
<pb facs="tcp:171431:4"/> in them; and accordingly falling upon the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them, he found (I suppose) no part of his Ministry more <hi>satisfactory</hi> to himself, or <hi>Savoury</hi> to others, than what he <hi>there</hi> Employ'd. It was not upon any Apprehensions which I have yet seen cause to change, that I did my self, divers months ago, single out the <hi>Types</hi> for one of my Two or Three or Four <hi>Weekly Sermons</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be taken up nithal; but having on <hi>Lords</hi>-Dayes in the Afternoons, discoursed more than a few Times thereupon, I find them like the Waters in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vision, Growing and Rising still, the further we wade into them. I am convinced that the gracious <hi>Valerius Herber,</hi> gwho hath writ a Book to prove, that in <hi>every Chapter</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is to be found something of our Blessed Jesus, might easily prove his Assertion, with a very great <hi>Redundancy</hi> of <hi>Demonstration;</hi> and that every paragraph of the Bible is a spot of Ground, where before we dig far, we shall find the <hi>Pearl of Great Price.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>My Wishes for you are, <hi>That Goodness and Mercy may follow you all the Days of your Lives, and that you may dwell in the</hi> Ark <hi>of the Lord, unto Length of Days.</hi> That <hi>None</hi> of you may be a <hi>Cham</hi> about the <hi>Ark,</hi> but that <hi>All</hi> of you may be bound up in the <hi>Bundle of Life.</hi> Have I found any thing in <hi>Cham,</hi> to Deprecate on your behalf? I have so in <hi>Noah</hi> too, in good old <hi>Noah</hi> himself. You know what <hi>Sin</hi> it
<pb facs="tcp:171431:7"/> was that <hi>Noah</hi> was overtaken with. One of the <hi>Ethnic Names,</hi> by which <hi>Noah</hi> was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, was that of <hi>Saturn;</hi> whom the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Pagans made the Praesident of <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> and hence they had their <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> or <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bouts,</hi> dedicated unto his Memory. 'Tis not a thing which never happens, that they whose Concerns Ly in <hi>Ships,</hi> have had more to do with <hi>Cups</hi> than has been for their Good; and they plead for themselves, as in <hi>Salvians</hi> complaint, they did of old, <hi>Si Noah, our non &amp; Ego?</hi> Why mayn't I Drink to Excess, as well as <hi>Noah? As well!</hi> Why it was <hi>not well</hi> in <hi>Noah;</hi> and tho' he had his <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which you have not, for an excuse, yet this <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> has issued in a <hi>Black Curse</hi> upon a great part of his miserable Family. But, blessed be God, the most of <hi>you,</hi> that are personally known unto my self, are persons exemplary for <hi>Sobriety.</hi> The Lord make you <hi>so,</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other vertue; and grant, <hi>That Denying Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and Worldly Lusts, you may Live Soberly, Righteously, and Godlily in this present World.</hi>

            <p>THe Wise Men that of old were Travelling and Enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord Jesus Christ, found Him a Babe in <hi>Swadling Cloaths</hi> and paid Respect unto Him, as unto the <hi>King of the World,</hi> As many of us

When we there Behold, let us there <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> there <hi>Adore</hi> our Blessed Lord, and offer the best of our Devotions to Him. 'Tis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by the great Apostle of the Gentiles, in Heb. 4. 2. <hi>Unto us was the Gospel Preached as well as unto them.</hi> Those <hi>Christians,</hi> for 'tis hardly a <hi>proletsis</hi> to call them <hi>so,</hi> that Lived before the Incarnation of our Lord, had glorious <hi>Gospel,</hi> in <hi>Shadows of good Things to come.</hi> A <hi>Type</hi> is in short, <hi>An instituted Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Gospel Mysteries.</hi> The things which the <hi>Gospel</hi> gives us a naked Representation of, were veiled under many <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Seals,</hi> which God made unto his Ancient People as it were, <hi>Sacraments of Good Things to come.</hi> And not only the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> but his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> His <hi>Endowments,</hi> His <hi>Benefits,</hi> and His <hi>Ordinances</hi> too, yea, and the <hi>Miseries,</hi> and the <hi>Enemies,</hi> from which we are by Him deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all of these were Preached in and by those <hi>Types</hi> of old. Now this <hi>Good-speech</hi> have we as well as <hi>They,</hi> by the Entertainment which the <hi>Types</hi> are every day giving to our serious Contemplations.</p>
            <p>It was the Observation of the Apostle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the memorable Events which in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171431:8"/> By-past Ages had happened in the Church of God, 1 Cor. 10. 11. <hi>All these things happened unto them, for</hi> Types, <hi>they are written for our Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As there were many <hi>Typical Men,</hi> to be found among the Saints of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> both <hi>Typical Persons,</hi> and <hi>Typical Orders;</hi> thus there were <hi>Typical Things,</hi> then likewise to be animadverted on. And those <hi>Typical Things</hi> are to be divided into two sorts; they were either more <hi>Occasional,</hi> or more <hi>Perpetual.</hi> For the more <hi>Occasional Typical Things,</hi> we may distribute <hi>Them</hi> into <hi>Typical Objects,</hi> and <hi>Typical Actions.</hi> In the Fleet of <hi>Occasional Typical Objects,</hi> methinks <hi>Noahs</hi> ARK may ride <hi>Admiral;</hi> 'tis the first; &amp; behold how the Apostle here declares the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> Nature &amp; Import of it. The Apostle here justly and fitly introduces a Discourse upon the <hi>Ark</hi> built by <hi>Noah</hi> long ago: in which <hi>Eight Souls were Saved by Water;</hi> that is, <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Wife, and his Three Sons, and their Wives being aboard, the <hi>Water</hi> of the Flood lifted up the <hi>Ark</hi> in which they were, so that they peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed not. The History of the <hi>Flood,</hi> and so of <hi>Ark,</hi> is too well known to need any distinct Repetition in this Discourse. But upon this he adds, in express terms, We have the AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITYPE thereof. And what is that <hi>Antitype?</hi> Why, as Water buoy'd up those that were in the <hi>Ark,</hi> so <hi>Baptism</hi> does those that are in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171431:9"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> towards Heaven; there is a blessed Help of <hi>Salvation</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Hence there is this <hi>Doctrine</hi> for us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>That</hi> Noahs <hi>ARK was Type of Gods CHURCH.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a <hi>Ship</hi> is by <hi>Humane</hi> Ingenuity, often made a Resemblance of the <hi>Church;</hi> so the <hi>Ark</hi> which was a sort of a <hi>Ship,</hi> is by <hi>Divine</hi> Authority, exhibited as a Figure or a Shadow of it. They compare the <hi>Pump</hi> in a <hi>Ship</hi> to Repentance, which fetches out the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that endangers our Souls. They compare the <hi>Sails,</hi> to our <hi>Affections;</hi> in which when the <hi>Wind</hi> of the holy Spirit blows, we are carried swiftly on to the <hi>Harbour</hi> of Eternal Blessedness. The <hi>Rudder,</hi> that <hi>is</hi> compared unto the <hi>Tongue</hi> of man; the <hi>Compass,</hi> that <hi>may be</hi> compared unto the <hi>Word</hi> of God. But these <hi>comparisons</hi> are inhumerable; as they that have read <hi>Navigation Spiritualized,</hi> by some Worthy English Writers, must needs be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and I hope every Gracious Marriner does accustome himself to such <hi>Reflections.</hi>

            <p> Well, that famous ARK which is counted the <hi>first</hi> SHIP that ever was, will afford then, a rich variety of <hi>Observations</hi> to us; and I suppose, you that follow the Employments of <hi>Ship-Carpenters,</hi> will give a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and profitable attention thereunto. The fairest Method in handling of the <hi>Types,</hi> is to Raise and Prove proper <hi>Observations,</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>Applications</hi> annexed unto them.

                     <p>Nor do you forget, that the <hi>Ark</hi> had <hi>Three Stories</hi> in it; each of them <hi>Fifteen Foot</hi> High apiece, abating the <hi>Sloping</hi> of one foot and an half at the <hi>Top,</hi> and (it may be) some place for <hi>Ballast</hi> under a Floor at the <hi>Bottom.</hi>

                  <p>In the <hi>Church</hi> of God, a <hi>Sabbath</hi> will be kept Holy to the Lord. It is a Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble passage in Gen. 8. 8, 10, 12. Noah <hi>sent forth a Dove; and he staid yet other Seven Days; and again he sent forth the Dove; and he staid yet other Seven Days, and sent forth the Dove.</hi> Why did <hi>Noah</hi> keep a period of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Days</hi> in this matter? Learned Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he had Respect unto a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in it; and a <hi>Sabbath</hi> too, say some Critical Enquirers, on that very Day of the Week which we count the <hi>First.</hi> It is thought, that on the morrow after the <hi>Sabbath</hi> he still sent out the <hi>Dove.</hi> And why not? We are assured in Gen. 2. 3. That from the very <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, <hi>God sanctified the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day;</hi> that is, He Commanded it to be Separated and Dedicated unto <hi>Sacred Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> among the Children of Men. To say, That at the Creation, God <hi>Sanctify'd the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day,</hi> by ordering that it should be kept Holy by a little people four &amp; twenty hundred years afterward, is an unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anticipation, and <hi>a cruel Hardship</hi> on the Text.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171431:27"/> That the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> long before <hi>Israel</hi> was Encamped at <hi>Marah,</hi> did use to keep an Holy Sabbath, in the <hi>Hebdomadal Revolution.</hi> Hence the Apostle at Heb. 4. 11. speaking of a <hi>Rest,</hi> which Unbelievers are excluded from, he plainly enough says, They were not excluded from the <hi>Rest</hi> (or Sabbath) which <hi>was from the Foundations of the world;</hi> so that such a <hi>Rest</hi> (or Sabbath) men then had an Interest in. Indeed the Sacrednes; of the Number, <hi>Seven,</hi> together with the Acknowledgment of it, as the measure of <hi>Time,</hi> among all Nations, except a few bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Indians whose <hi>Time</hi> is denominated only by <hi>Sleeps</hi> and <hi>Moons</hi> and <hi>Winters,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily be ascribed unto any other Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but the mark which God at the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> did put upon <hi>One Day</hi> in <hi>Seven,</hi> as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Himself. A <hi>Seventh</hi> Day is to be kept as a <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, in the <hi>Ark</hi> of God; tho' it seems to be not THE Seventh Day, but the <hi>First</hi> which our Sabbath is now tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>slated into. Our Saviour Himself requires e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>New</hi> Testament, to be solicitous, that nothing may hinder us, from keeping a <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Lord. Our Lord advised his Disciples, about the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses which even after His Resurrection and Ascension, they should be exposed unto, in Mat. 24. 20. <hi>Pray, that your Flight be not</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:171431:27"/>
                     <hi>on the Sabbath Day.</hi> VVhy so? The <hi>Jewish</hi> Coeremonies were then Abrogated and Abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lished; and our Lord refers to a <hi>Time,</hi> when the <hi>Laws</hi> which made <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> fall under a civil penalty, would be <hi>silent</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; yet have we a <hi>Sabbath</hi> still, which 'tis grivous and a bitter thing to be distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in.</p>

                     <hi>There are but Few that shall be Saved.</hi> Says the Apostle here, <hi>In the Ark, Few, That is, Eight Souls were saved.</hi> He that ponders the Longevity of the Antediluvian Patriarchs, will not wonder at them, who affirm it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. <hi>That more people perished in the Flood, than are now alive in the world.</hi> For let us make a Computation with as much Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our own Assertion, as can Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be desired. We'l abate two or three of the first Centuries, by which time the world might be supply'd with people not a few; and we'l suppose a man to have Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren at <hi>sixty,</hi> and in the Next <hi>Forty</hi> years, to have <hi>Twenty</hi> Children. Now single out the <hi>shortest Liver</hi> of any mentioned (except <hi>Enoch)</hi> before the <hi>Flood;</hi> and from that one Stock of <hi>seven hundred years,</hi> multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still by Twenty, we shall find the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to be more than One Thousand, Three Hundred, and Forty seven Millions; thus
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171431:33"/> that <hi>One Family</hi> would long before the Flood have afforded, it may be as many people as are now Living on the Earth. Moreover, if we consider that within a very few Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of years <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Flood,</hi> Histories tell us of <hi>one, Army,</hi> in which were, <hi>Thirteen Hundred Thousand</hi> Foot, <hi>Five Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> Horse, <hi>One Hundred Thousand</hi> Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and as many Camels; and <hi>this Army</hi> Encountred by a greater Force; it may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate our Belief, of the wonderful popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losity which might be before. But what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of all that <hi>Mighty People?</hi> Truly, all were <hi>Drown'd</hi> but <hi>Eight Souls!</hi> And though it be not for us to Censure too far upon the Eternal Condition of that miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: it being possible that <hi>more</hi> than we know of might be <hi>Happy</hi> for ever, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their <hi>Drowning</hi> here; yet the Scripture speaks very sadly about the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them, whom the <hi>Waters</hi> did exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. We read in Job 22. 15, 16, 17. That they were <hi>wicked men.</hi> Compare Mat. 24. 38, 39. And we are told in 1 Pet. 3: 19, 20. Their <hi>Spirits are now in Prison.</hi> The Jews themselves therefore pass that Sentence on them, <hi>That they were punished with the scalding Waters of Gehinnom.</hi> Even so, They that shall be Saved, <hi>How many are they?</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:171431:34"/> They are as we are informed in Luke 12. 32. A <hi>Little, Little Flock!</hi> Divide all the World at this Day into <hi>Thirty One</hi> parts, <hi>Nineteen</hi> are Idolaters, <hi>Seven</hi> are Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and scarce <hi>Five</hi> are so much as called Christians. But of them that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> how few have that <hi>Holiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man shall see the Lord?</hi> how few have true <hi>Faith?</hi> Yet <hi>he that Believeth not shall be Damned.</hi> It is indeed a principle in the Turkish <hi>Alcoran,</hi> That <hi>Let a mans Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be what it will, he shall be saved, if he Conscienciously Live up to the Rules of it.</hi> And they are <hi>Mahometans</hi> rather than <hi>Christians,</hi> who shall defend a principle so derogatory to the vertue of the Gospel. The Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> very justly tell us, <hi>They are to be held Accursed, who presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sest which he professeth; so that he be Diligent to frame his Life according to that Law, and Light of Nature. For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us, only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be Saved.</hi> But alas, how <hi>few</hi> are there that savingly Believe, Profess, Obey, that <hi>Lord of Glory!</hi> This <hi>Gate of Life</hi> has that Motto on it in Mat. 7. 14. <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi>

                  <p>Let us all make that <hi>Use</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our made, of this astonishing Truth, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait Gate.</hi> Be very anxious, I beseech you, about your own <hi>Salvation.</hi> When it was of old said, <hi>That one among twelve should be a child of Perdition,</hi> they all became inquisitive, <hi>Lord is it I?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, you are told now, <hi>That more than twelve to one shall be the Children of Perdition:</hi> O how should this make us to be solicitous, lest <hi>We</hi> be <hi>some</hi> of <hi>them!</hi> Remember, that it is a no less <hi>common</hi> than <hi>dreadful thing,</hi> to be deceived in this matter. We are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the wayes of Death.</hi> The biggest part of them that go down to the Sulphureous Lakes of Hell make that one of their <hi>first Shrieks</hi> at their coming there, <hi>We little thought of this!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O let every one of <hi>Us</hi> get into the ARK, and be extreamly careful that we be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who are <hi>Deceivers of their own Souls.</hi> May the God of all Grace, awaken us from our Lethargic <hi>Security,</hi> and to an
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171431:35"/> extraordinary <hi>Sedulity,</hi> in matters▪ of our Eternal <hi>Salvation;</hi> may He help us to <hi>give all diligence in making our Calling and Election sure;</hi> and to <hi>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
